# PASSWORD-PROTECTED-LOCK-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-HOME-SECURITY
The goal of this project is to design and simulate a password-based locking system, in order
to demonstrate its reliability, cost efficiency and user-friendliness. This system is easy to
understand and operate, yet provides assurance of safety and security for oneâ€™s family and
possessions.
